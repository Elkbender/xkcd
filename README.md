## The Challenge

A client has just discovered [xkcd comics](https://xkcd.com/).

Disregarding the abundance of similar apps in the Play store, she wants to create a comic viewer app, right now! She came up with a list of requirements, too! The user should be able to:

- browse through the comics,
- see the comic details, including its description,
- search for comics by the comic number as well as text,
- get the comic explanation
- favorite the comics, which would be available offline too,
- send comics to others,
- get notifications when a new comic is published,
- support multiple form factors.

Quite a list! :scream: 

Luckily, there are a few services available to ease some of the bullet points. There's the [xkcd JSON API](https://xkcd.com/json.html), which can be used to access the comics. Then there's [xkcd search](https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com/), which can help with the search. Finally, there's [explain xkcd](http://www.explainxkcd.com/), which offers the explanation for all the comics. 

## The Task

Pick a few features for an MVP.
